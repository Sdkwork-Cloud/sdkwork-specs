# Standards Governance

- Version: 1.0
- Scope: spec ownership, changes, exceptions, compatibility, lifecycle gates, release, migration, supply-chain governance
- Related: `SOUL.md`, `AGENTS_SPEC.md`, `SDKWORK_WORKSPACE_SPEC.md`, `REQUIREMENTS_SPEC.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_SPEC.md`, `ENGINEERING_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`, `CODE_REVIEW_SPEC.md`, `QUALITY_GATE_SPEC.md`, `RELEASE_SPEC.md`, `MIGRATION_SPEC.md`, `SUPPLY_CHAIN_SECURITY_SPEC.md`, `CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md`, `NAMING_SPEC.md`, all specs

This document defines how SDKWork standards evolve without fragmenting across applications.

## 1. Authority

Global `sdkwork-specs/*_SPEC.md` files are the platform source of truth for SDKWork standards.

Repository/application machine contracts live in root `specs/` and module `specs/component.spec.json`.
README files and `docs/` are discovery layers per `SOUL.md` section 2.1; they are not competing standards.

Rules:

- Local app standards may extend global standards, but must not contradict them.
- `SOUL.md` defines shared SDKWork agent behavior. Local agent instructions may narrow execution for a repository, but they must not weaken the soul principles.
- `AGENTS_SPEC.md` defines `AGENTS.md` and compatibility shims such as `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and `CODEX.md`. Local agent entrypoints must link to root standards instead of becoming competing standards.
- Repository/application `.sdkwork/` skills and plugins may automate or explain standards, but they
  must not become competing standards. They follow `SDKWORK_WORKSPACE_SPEC.md`.
- If two specs conflict, the more specific root spec wins for its domain.
- If root specs conflict, the conflict must be fixed before implementation continues.

## 2. Change Types

| Change type | Examples | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clarification | Better wording, examples | Review and update affected docs |
| Additive | New optional extension, new recommended module | Tests if executable behavior changes |
| Breaking | Rename operationId, change token header, change required DB field | Migration plan and explicit approval |
| Lifecycle gate | Change Definition of Ready, Definition of Done, review rule, merge gate, release gate, or exception gate | `QUALITY_GATE_SPEC.md` evidence and reviewer approval |
| Release-affecting | Change versioning, artifact, rollout, rollback, changelog, signing, or publication policy | `RELEASE_SPEC.md` and `SUPPLY_CHAIN_SECURITY_SPEC.md` review |
| Supply-chain | Change dependency source, generator authority, build integrity, signing, SBOM, provenance, or attestation policy | Security review, supply-chain evidence, and exception expiry when policy is weakened |
| Exception | Temporary legacy deviation | Exception record with owner and expiry |

## 3. Exception Record

Every exception must include:

```yaml
id: EX-2026-0001
spec: API_SPEC.md
rule: operationId dotted resource style
owner: team-name
reason: legacy generated SDK migration
risk: inconsistent SDK surface
expires_at: 2026-06-30
removal_plan: regenerate app SDK with sdkwork-v3 profile
```

## 4. Compatibility Rules

- API compatibility follows `API_SPEC.md`.
- Database compatibility follows `DATABASE_SPEC.md`.
- SDK compatibility follows `SDK_SPEC.md`.
- RPC compatibility follows `RPC_SPEC.md`.
- RPC framework compatibility follows `RPC_FRAMEWORK_SPEC.md`.
- Discovery compatibility follows `DISCOVERY_SPEC.md`.
- Domain naming and ownership follows `DOMAIN_SPEC.md`.
- Reusable module compatibility follows `MODULE_SPEC.md`.
- App manifest compatibility follows `APP_MANIFEST_SPEC.md`.
- Repository/application workspace compatibility follows `SDKWORK_WORKSPACE_SPEC.md`.
- Repository baseline compatibility follows `REPOSITORY_BASELINE_SPEC.md`.
- Agent entrypoint compatibility follows `AGENTS_SPEC.md`.
- Code style compatibility follows `CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md` and the relevant language-specific spec only for touched languages.
- Naming compatibility follows `NAMING_SPEC.md`.
- Requirements compatibility follows `REQUIREMENTS_SPEC.md`; requirement changes must preserve traceability to acceptance criteria and verification evidence.
- Architecture decision compatibility follows `ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_SPEC.md`; superseded decisions must stay discoverable until affected implementations and docs migrate.
- Engineering workflow compatibility follows `ENGINEERING_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`; local workflow automation may narrow checkpoints but must not remove clarification, verification, review, or evidence requirements.
- Code review compatibility follows `CODE_REVIEW_SPEC.md`; local review rules may add stricter ownership but must not treat generated artifacts, security changes, or standards changes as review-free.
- Quality gate compatibility follows `QUALITY_GATE_SPEC.md`; local gates may add checks but must not weaken Definition of Ready, Definition of Done, merge gates, release gates, or exception evidence.
- Release compatibility follows `RELEASE_SPEC.md`; release trains, versioning, changelog, rollout, rollback, and freeze rules must remain aligned with app manifests and workflow packaging.
- Migration compatibility follows `MIGRATION_SPEC.md`; breaking or compatibility-sensitive changes require migration plan, compatibility window, rollback, and owner approval.
- Supply-chain compatibility follows `SUPPLY_CHAIN_SECURITY_SPEC.md`; dependency, build, generated artifact, SBOM, provenance, signing, checksum, and attestation rules cannot be weakened without explicit security exception.
- UI architecture compatibility follows `UI_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`, `APP_CLIENT_ARCHITECTURE_ALIGNMENT_SPEC.md`, `APP_PC_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`, `APP_H5_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`, `FLUTTER_APP_MOBILE_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`, `MINI_PROGRAM_APP_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`, `ANDROID_APP_MOBILE_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`, `IOS_APP_MOBILE_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`, `HARMONY_APP_MOBILE_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`, `APP_PC_REACT_UI_SPEC.md`, `APP_MOBILE_REACT_UI_SPEC.md`, `APP_FLUTTER_UI_SPEC.md`, `APP_MINI_PROGRAM_UI_SPEC.md`, `APP_ANDROID_NATIVE_UI_SPEC.md`, `APP_IOS_NATIVE_UI_SPEC.md`, `APP_HARMONY_NATIVE_UI_SPEC.md`, and `BACKEND_UI_SPEC.md`.
- Security rules cannot be weakened by local exception without explicit owner approval and compensating control.

UI architecture boundary exceptions are breaking architecture exceptions. They must include a migration plan back to the correct package family and SDK surface. In particular, new PC application packages may not omit the `pc` segment; PC user console modules may not be named as admin modules; PC internal admin modules may not be named as user console or app modules; backend/admin UI may not use a single catch-all backend package as an exception unless the record names every affected domain package that will receive the split before expiry.

## 5. Review Checklist

- [ ] Correct spec files were consulted.
- [ ] Requirements and acceptance criteria were added or updated when behavior, contract, runtime, security, release, or migration intent changed.
- [ ] Architecture decisions were recorded or superseded when boundaries, ownership, runtime topology, or cross-client alignment changed.
- [ ] `SOUL.md`, `AGENTS_SPEC.md`, `CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md`, and `NAMING_SPEC.md` were updated or cited when agent behavior, execution entrypoints, code structure, or public naming changed.
- [ ] Repository/application `.sdkwork/` skills or plugins do not contradict root standards.
- [ ] Repository/application `AGENTS.md` files do not contradict root standards or copy stale spec bodies.
- [ ] Tool compatibility files such as `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and `CODEX.md` point to `AGENTS.md` and do not become competing standards.
- [ ] Changes do not create conflicting standards.
- [ ] Review evidence follows `CODE_REVIEW_SPEC.md`, and merge/release/exception evidence follows `QUALITY_GATE_SPEC.md`.
- [ ] Release-affecting changes cite `RELEASE_SPEC.md` and supply-chain-affecting changes cite `SUPPLY_CHAIN_SECURITY_SPEC.md`.
- [ ] Compatibility-sensitive changes include a `MIGRATION_SPEC.md` migration plan with rollback and owner.
- [ ] Any exception is documented with owner and expiry.
- [ ] Tooling or tests were updated when a standard becomes executable.
- [ ] AGENTS.md references still point to global `sdkwork-specs` and local machine contracts under `specs/`.
