# App iOS Native UI Standard

- Version: 1.0
- Scope: app/user-facing iOS native packages, SwiftUI or UIKit UI, generated Swift app SDK integration, iOS host adapters, mobile interaction, and package-local state
- Related: `API_SPEC.md`, `APPLICATION_SPEC.md`, `APP_CLIENT_ARCHITECTURE_ALIGNMENT_SPEC.md`, `IOS_APP_MOBILE_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`, `APP_SDK_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md`, `COMPONENT_SPEC.md`, `CONFIG_SPEC.md`, `DOMAIN_SPEC.md`, `FRONTEND_SPEC.md`, `UI_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`, `IAM_LOGIN_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md`, `I18N_SPEC.md`, `MODULE_SPEC.md`, `NAMING_SPEC.md`, `SDK_SPEC.md`, `SECURITY_SPEC.md`, `TEST_SPEC.md`

This standard defines how SDKWork app-side iOS native UI is packaged and integrated. In application roots it is applied after `IOS_APP_MOBILE_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`; in shared package families it remains the detailed iOS native package standard. iOS UI packages are app/user-facing and consume app-api through generated Swift app SDK clients or approved appbase iOS wrappers. They must not consume backend/admin UI packages or backend SDKs for user-facing workflows.

This standard is selected through `UI_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md` and applies only to app/user-facing iOS native packages.

Canonical app-root iOS package shape:

```text
apps/<product>-ios-mobile/
  packages/
    sdkwork-<product>-ios-mobile-core/
    sdkwork-<product>-ios-mobile-commons/
    sdkwork-<product>-ios-mobile-shell/
    sdkwork-<product>-ios-mobile-<capability>/
```

Optional shared iOS package shape:

```text
packages/ios-native/
  iam/
  foundation/
  commerce/
  communication/
  content/
  intelligence/
  system/
```

## 1. Surface Boundary

Rules:

- iOS app UI `MUST` live in normalized iOS application packages such as `apps/<product>-ios-mobile/packages/sdkwork-<product>-ios-mobile-<capability>` or approved shared iOS package families such as `packages/ios-native/<domain>/<package>`.
- iOS app UI `MUST` consume `/app/v3/api` through generated Swift app SDK clients or approved wrappers.
- iOS app UI `MUST NOT` consume `/backend/v3/api`, backend SDK packages, backend React packages, Flutter packages, Android packages, or Harmony packages for user-facing workflows.
- Operator/admin screens require a separately approved iOS admin package family and must follow backend-api and backend SDK rules.
- iOS framework and platform APIs such as camera, biometric, keychain, push, universal links, files, and lifecycle `MUST` go through typed host adapters.

## 2. Package Split

| Package type | Naming | Owns | Must not own |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| iOS app shell | `sdkwork-<product>-ios-mobile-shell` or app-specific iOS shell | navigation stack/tab/sheet composition, providers, AuthGate, route composition | reusable domain features |
| iOS foundation package | `sdkwork-<product>-ios-mobile-commons` or `sdkwork-<foundation>-ios-native` | domain-neutral UI primitives, theme adapters, form/list/error primitives, i18n helpers | business-domain shortcuts |
| iOS domain package | `sdkwork-<product>-ios-mobile-<capability>` or `sdkwork-<capability>-ios-native` | screens, views, view models/controllers, services, repositories, state, localization, route metadata | concrete SDK construction, backend admin logic |
| iOS host package | `sdkwork-<product>-ios-mobile-host` or `sdkwork-<host>-ios-native` when needed | iOS platform API adapters, permissions, lifecycle, keychain, camera/QR/share/push/universal links | API business logic |

Rules:

- iOS packages `MUST` be split by domain/capability.
- A single iOS package `MUST NOT` accumulate unrelated backend-like business modules.
- Shared UI primitives remain domain-neutral unless they live inside the owning domain package.
- iOS packages may share app SDK port contracts conceptually with other client packages, but must not depend on their UI/runtime code.

## 3. Internal Shape

Recommended app-root package structure:

```text
apps/<product>-ios-mobile/packages/sdkwork-<product>-ios-mobile-<capability>/
  Package.swift
  Sources/
    Sdkwork<Product>IosMobile<Capability>/
      PublicApi.swift
      Screens/
      Components/
      Presentation/
        ViewModels/
        Controllers/
      Services/
      Repositories/
      State/
      I18n/
      Routes/
      Navigation/
      Host/
      Models/
      Resources/
  Tests/
  specs/
```

Recommended shared package structure:

```text
packages/ios-native/<domain>/<package>/
  Package.swift
  Sources/
  Tests/
  specs/
```

Rules:

- The package public API file exports integration contracts and composition helpers.
- `Screens/` owns route-level UI.
- `Components/` owns reusable or domain-specific components.
- `Presentation/` owns view models/controllers and UI state mapping.
- `Services/` owns use-case orchestration.
- `Repositories/` owns thin generated app SDK calls where repository naming is used.
- `I18n/`, `Resources/`, and platform localization files own package-local locale fragments. Platform resource aggregates must be generated or assembled from fragments and must not be hand-authored whole-app catalogs; follow `I18N_SPEC.md`.
- `Models/` owns view models only. API DTOs come from generated Swift app SDKs.
- `Host/` owns adapter interfaces for platform capabilities.

## 4. SDK And Host Integration

Rules:

- iOS services/repositories `MUST` receive generated app SDK clients or narrow app SDK ports through dependency injection.
- iOS runtime/bootstrap `MUST` construct generated Swift app SDK clients, appbase SDK clients or approved appbase iOS wrappers, one global token-manager equivalent, token/context storage, and host adapters.
- iOS IAM integration `MUST` use generated appbase app SDK resources or an approved appbase iOS wrapper for login, registration, current session, refresh, logout, verification, OAuth, QR auth, password reset, runtime metadata, and current-user self-service.
- If an appbase iOS wrapper is missing a required resource, the missing capability `MUST` be added to appbase app-api/OpenAPI/generator inputs and regenerated. iOS packages `MUST NOT` fill the gap with raw HTTP calls, manual headers, or copied TypeScript/Flutter logic.
- UI and view models `MUST NOT` construct SDK clients, attach auth/API key headers, parse JWTs for authorization, or call raw HTTP for business transport.
- Platform capabilities must be behind interfaces so tests can use fake adapters.
- Generated SDK output `MUST NOT` be hand-edited.

## 5. iOS Interaction And Design

Rules:

- iOS UI must be phone-first, touch-first, safe-area-aware, Dynamic Type aware, and usable across common iPhone sizes and iPad windows when the app supports them.
- New UI should use SwiftUI state and navigation patterns or an approved root state pattern; UIKit must not bypass service and host adapter boundaries.
- Screens must handle loading, empty, validation-error, permission-denied, offline/unavailable, and unknown-error states.
- Forms must support keyboard avoidance, autofill hints where appropriate, accessible labels, and duplicate-submit protection.
- QR scan, OAuth redirect, verification-code, push permission, and password reset flows must handle foreground/background transitions.
- Theme usage must come from the app design system or package-injected theme adapters. Domain packages must not redefine global themes.

## 6. Security

Rules:

- Tokens should be stored through approved iOS secure storage/keychain adapters where available.
- Secure storage may persist centralized token/context state, but it `MUST NOT` own login, token refresh, permission checks, or business authorization.
- Logout, refresh failure, tenant switch, and account switch `MUST` clear secure storage, global token-manager equivalent, context store, sensitive iOS state, and realtime/session bridges.
- Verification codes, OAuth codes, password reset tokens, QR keys, access tokens, refresh tokens, and push tokens `MUST NOT` be logged or placed in crash/analytics breadcrumbs.
- Deep links and universal links must validate expected scheme/host/path, state, nonce, and expiry before completing sensitive flows.
- Frontend permission checks are hints only. App-api authorization remains mandatory.

## 7. Testing

Required coverage for new iOS capabilities:

| Test | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Package boundary | Static scan proves packages follow `sdkwork-<product>-ios-mobile-*` or approved shared iOS package names and do not deep-import another package's private source. |
| SDK boundary | Static scan proves generated SDK clients or approved wrappers are used and no raw HTTP, manual auth headers, or generated SDK edits were introduced. |
| Service/view model | Unit tests use fake generated app SDK clients and fake host adapters. |
| UI states | SwiftUI/UIKit tests or documented fixtures cover loading, empty, validation-error, permission-denied, unavailable, and unknown-error states. |
| IAM clearing | Tests prove secure storage, token manager, context store, caches, and sensitive state clear on logout, refresh failure, tenant switch, and account switch. |
| Host boundary | Static scan proves feature UI does not call iOS platform APIs directly for host capabilities. |

Acceptance checklist:

- [ ] iOS UI package placement follows `IOS_APP_MOBILE_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`.
- [ ] Packages are split by domain/capability and expose only public integration contracts.
- [ ] Route ids and localization keys align with other client architectures where workflows match.
- [ ] Services use generated app SDK clients or approved wrappers through injection.
- [ ] iOS platform APIs are behind typed host adapters.
- [ ] UI covers mobile interaction states and lifecycle constraints.
- [ ] Security-sensitive platform facts and tokens are not logged or persisted insecurely.
- [ ] Verification evidence is recorded before completion.
